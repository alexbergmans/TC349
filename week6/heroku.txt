The homepage of Heroku has a very cool color scheme: The purples, blues, and darker colors really make it look sleek. One thing I really like about the homepage's content is the information tabs and their interactivity. Clicking through "Forget Servers", "Run Anything", "See Anything", and "Trust and Manage" has very smooth animation and is visually appealing to me. The faded buttons at the bottom of the page just above the footer are cool because when you hover the mouse over them, they "unfade", or whatever and become colorful and bright. Very good easy access.
One thing that I don't really like about the site, is that I am overwhelmed right off the bat. There is too much information being shown to me on the home page. As a person who doesn't have much experience or knowledge in Heroku's field, I feel a little lost when I open up the page. I don't know where to begin, because the header, the content, and the footer all look equally important and I don't really know the difference between what each section is trying to offer me or take me to.

I chose TextMate, now open sourced, over Dreamweaver for my setup. Dreamweaver writes the code for me, so I figured it wouldn't be the best way to learn how to deal with html. Textmate helps a little bit, but it doesn't do as much as Dreamweaver. If the guy teaching me prefers it I might as well check it out.
I found this program online and downloaded it. I probably need some practice with this program in order to get a feel for it, even though it seems pretty straightforward at this point. I want to learn how to write html naturally, and that's why I chose TextMate over DreamWeaver.

The red, black and white color scheme seems really fitting for the website, as well as the use of whitespace on the left and right sides of the screen. The interface is very cool. The interactions and animations of links to other parts of the site are smooth. It gives a very minimalist and contemporary vibe, making the site show off that Jason Santa Maria is a graphic designer.
The main page does not overwhelm. It is a simplified, chronological blog-style series of posts done by the author. The posts aren't expansive, and just give samples of the post, with links to the full post. This is another way that it doesn't overwhelm the visitor. The articles section has a very useful section that allows the user to sort the articles listed in the section using the array of keywords at the top of the page. The footer of the website seems to be a little big, and might include a little too much information, especially in comparison to the rest of the site, but overall it's set up in a pretty visually appealing way.

The thing I like about this mobile site is that, unlike many mobile sites I've come across, the main menu is extremely simplified. It's simplified into basically a map or navigation of the site. Too often I stumble across a mobile site that tries to fit way too much information onto the main page, which can make navigation really difficult for my touch-screen phone. It also can take a while to load, depending on my access to WiFi or Mobile Network.
The site is visually appealing, in a minimal sort of way. The header at the top is pretty self-explanatory. The search bar comes next, to help the user find that "specific thing" they came to the site to search for. If the search bar isn't really your thing, you have a set of various icons that can take you to whatever part of the site you feel you want to visit. These icons have pictures associated with the section of the site that it takes you to. The bare minimum is the best decision here, because it's far from confusing, and very streamlined. Lack of clutter on mobile devices is almost always a good thing.

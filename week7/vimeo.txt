The first thing I noticed when I went to Vimeo's homepage was the frantic requests for the user to join their website. I know a big goal of the site is to get people to join, but it seems to be trying too hard to get the person to join. Before I get information as to what, exactly, the site's purpose and use is, I'm bombarded with queries begging me to sign up for the site. The first thing I see when I get to the site is an enormous "Fill in the information" text field to join and create an account for the site, which is a little demanding. There's another field at the bottom of the home page asking for the user to join the site, with all the other information between.
The graphic and the horizontal navigation at the top of the page are aesthetically pleasing, especially since the graphic is static with the exception of the shimmering logo, which I thought was a nifty touch. The organization is the long-scrolling blog-type page that I saw earlier on the chartbeat website. This is a pretty common format for websites, and it's one of the more aesthetically pleasing setups that a website can have. A problem I have with the organization of the information on the homepage is the fact that the section with "Videos that are interesting" is above the section telling the reader what the site is about. I think this was poor planning, because the priorities should be reversed. Other than that, very smooth site.

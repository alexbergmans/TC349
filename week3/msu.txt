The Michigan State website is pretty well put together. The color scheme is very professional and visually appealing, while, at the same time, it stays true to the university's colors. The site navigation bar at the top of the screen is very self-explanatory, with the main sections of the site being easily navigable. The drop-down menus that appear when you hover over the different buttons are helpful and eye-catching. They don't seem forced or out of place.
The main page's slideshow of main stories is very smooth and visually appealing. The sidewipe/dissolve effect is a very cool transition from one image to another. The "MSUTALK" bar near the bottom of the page seems a little forced, because it seems like the website is trying a little too hard to try to "fit in" with the new trend of college students getting twitter accounts, especially since the tweets the bar is displaying aren't really helpful, informative or interesting.

The website I chose for this assignment was a site called cashoutsports.com, which is a free sports betting site that I use for fun. I access it from my phone on many occasions so I am pretty familiar with the site. The site does not have a separate mobile layout, because when I access the site from my phone it gives me the exact same dimensions from the normal site for everything, and I constantly need to zoom in and out in order to perform certain actions on the site, which is pretty obnoxious in my opinion.
There is a feature on the site where after the user makes a bet he can opt for a bonus on the returns from his bet. It generates a random percentage and shows the user an ad, and the user can opt to "try for a new bonus" by refreshing the page, percentage and ad. When the page refreshes, it zooms all the way back out to a distant overview of the page because my mobile Firefox browser is trying to tackle a site designed for platforms that aren't mobile. Another issue with the site is that the "autofill" for forms scrolls up in front of where the typing is entered, which is disruptive and obnoxious. This makes the site pretty janky to access through mobile phones. The good thing is that all sections of the site are available with full features in the mobile site.

The first thing I noticed about this website was the interactivity in the design. When I would scroll down, certain elements would react with the scrolling and move. The foremost thing that reacted to the scrolling was the three circles that were revolving around the real-time counter that kept track of "People across all sites". This reaction to the scrolling is very cool and eyecatching. Other things included the different "fields" in the background once you got closer to the bottom of the page that included the RSS logo, the twitter logo, search icon and other symbols floating and reacting to the scrolling. There is also a life-updating counter at the foot of the page that keeps track of just how many pixels worth of scrolling I had done. These are all really interesting and make the whole site very interesting and visually appealing.

The pixel counter and the "People across all sites" counter are excellent examples of the the site's "Real-time data for front-line doers" that they specialize in. The page shows off the capabilities of the real-time data and different features, showing if the reader is idle, counting how long the user has been engaged, and the location of the user. It's showing examples of the features all on one really tall page, which is as much of a presentation or sales pitch as it is a website. It can be a little overwhelming, because of all the scrolling that needs to be done to get from the top to the bottom of the page, but the "pixel count" feature it's advertising almost justifies it.

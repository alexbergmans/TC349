Right off the bat, the first thing I notice is the site's whitespace on the left and right of the page. There is a considerable amount of unused space on the left and right, as all the content is centered, and they have not resorted to using obnoxious side-ads in order to fill the space. There's also lots of whitespace in between the content in the middle of the page, in addition to the sides. It's a very nice and soothing aesthetic. It helps me not feel overwhelmed by the site.

The top bar that includes the search option is logical and convenient. The vertical navigation on the left side of the page has a lot more items than the horizontal navigation at the top, which is better, in my opinion. The use of white space and soft colors make it a very calming website, and it doesn't seem to convolluted or cluttered.

	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	<div id="words">
	<p>One of my biggest hobbies from my early life was travel. My parents would take me on a trip to cool parts of the country, such as Glacier National Park (see above) every summer. It was a huge part of my life, visiting and taking in the scenery of all the beautiful places my country had to offer. Unfortunately, I have done very little travel as of late. I hope to do more in the future, as one of my main life goals is to visit europe.</p>
	<p>Another one of my biggest hobbies is film. I enjoy taking in films from other countries, and other time periods. Every new film is a brand new experience, seeing the world through someone else's eyes. Different visuals, cinematography, narratives, cultures, it's endlessly entertaining.</p>
	<p>I am also a huge fan of music. I enjoy all genres of music. I like listening to new albums every day. It teaches me a lot about music and culture and how people think and live. I also play guitar in my free time, and I'm getting pretty good at it. I hope to perhaps someday form a band.</p>

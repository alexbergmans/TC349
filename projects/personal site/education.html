	<p>Alex spent his early education days in the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools public school system. He attended Bentley Elementary School from Kindergarten to 2nd Grade, and Miller Elementary School from 3rd to 5th Grade. He transferred to the other Elementary for 3rd grade because he was accepted into the school system's Talented and Gifted program. He attended middle school, or grades 6 through 8 at East Middle School in Plymouth, MI. For High School he attended the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park, which contains three schools: Plymouth High School, Salem High School, and Canton High School. He was officially a member of Plymouth High School, though he attended classes at all three. He was also a member of the National Honors Society during his High School years.</p>
	<p>After graduating from Plymouth High School, Alex attended Michigan State University. He has attended the University since August 2010. He is enrolled in the Media and Information degree program</p>

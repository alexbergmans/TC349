	<p>Alex spent his early education days in the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools public school system. He attended Bentley Elementary School from Kindergarten to 2nd Grade, and Miller Elementary School from 3rd to 5th Grade. He transferred to the other Elementary for 3rd grade because he was accepted into the school system's Talented and Gifted program. He attended middle school, or grades 6 through 8 at East Middle School in Plymouth, MI. For High School he attended the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park, which contains three schools: Plymouth High School, Salem High School, and Canton High School.

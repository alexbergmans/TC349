The first thing I noticed when visting the website was the header and its horizontal navigation. The red logo on the left is a nice touch, as well as the shopping cart icon on the right. But the horizontal navigation is cluttered and small. There are many choices, and the text is not as big as it needs to be. Each navigation link is a little too small of a target for the mouse to easily land on, so if they were made bigger, and perhaps they consolidated the categories, it would be better and easier for the user.
The main content of the home page doesn't seem to have any sort of logic or organization to it. They get right into the products with prices and descriptions, and it's overwhelming. The hover animation that occurs when you hover over the products is nifty, but there's no breathing room in between the constant barrage of products being pushed. Sure, the in-your-face promotion of the products can work for some people, but I find it slightly irritating. In the middle of the mess of content, there's some random placements of links to their twitter feed and a text field to enter your email for their newsletter, but they are placed so illogically that they're pretty easy to miss.
The one part of the page that I think they did correctly was the footer. It's a standard footer that isn't nearly as cluttered as the rest of the website. It's very visually appealing, and spacious, and is able to accomplish more than the rest of the page combined.

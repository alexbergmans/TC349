The first thing I see when I get to happycog.com's home page is their logo, and a brief but informative statement about what the organization does, along with a link to a way to contact them in order to possible schedule a partnership. This is a simple, yet important piece in the web page, because too often a site will not inform the visitor what the goal or purpose of the organization is right off the bat. If the visitor has to search for the purpose, then the website has not effectively been organized. The header's logo does a cool animation when the cursor hovers over it, and the color change in the horizontal navigation when there's a hover is also a nice touch.
The main content of the website is set up in that "long-scrolling page with a header and footer" setup that I've seen in many of the other sites I've had to write about. It's kind of a blog-style format, with links to several notable projects the organization has worked on, including the MTV O awards. This is a good choice, content-wise, as it solidifies the organization's credibility and speaks volumes toward their skill level.

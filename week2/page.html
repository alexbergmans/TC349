	<h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
	<p>The first thing I noticed while visiting panic.com's homepage, was the exaggerated size of everything on the page. The images/buttons/links on the main page are very large and you have to do a lot of scrolling to get yourself oriented. Personally, I would shrink the size of the page so it would fit a lot nicer and I would have to do a lot less exploring in order to get a grip on what to do on the page.</p>
	<p>Beyond the questionable large icons, I enjoyed the interactivity of the buttons that brought you to the download centers for the website's different apps. The way they grew and additional info faded in when you hovered over them was nice and smooth. They bring a casual and "hip" vibe to their page, which is definitely a good aspect, considering the fact that their target audience would feel more comfortable with this vibe. Nobody likes to be scared away by tight-collared in-your-face professionalism.</p>
